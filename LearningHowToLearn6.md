# 5 preventing procrastination: Enlisting Your Habits ("Zombies") as Helpers
> 1. Understanding something of the cognitive psychology of procrastination, just like understanding the chemistry of poison, can help us develop healthy preventative.s
> 2. This means you'll be learning about our inner zombies - the routine, habitual responses your brain falls into as a result of specific cues. These zombie responses are often focused on making the here and now better. As you'll see, you can trick soome of these zombies into helping you to fend off procrastination when you need to (not all procrastination is bad).
> 3. Unlike procrastination, which is easy to fall into, willpower is hard to come by because it uses a lot of neural resources. This means that the last thing you want to do in tackling procrastination is to go around spraying willpower on it like it's cheap air freshener. You shouldn't waste willpower on procrastination except when absolutely necessary!

1. 拖延也有两面性，不是所有拖延都是坏事，那什么情况下拖延是好事呢？
2. 我们很容易陷入拖延，用意志力这种耗费能量的方法去克服很难，那有什么好办法呢？

## Procrastination and Discomfort
> 1. We procrastinate about things that make us feel uncomfortable.
> 2. It was the anticipation that was painful. When the mathphobes actually did math, the pain disappeared. Procrastination expert Rita Emmett explains: "The dread of doing a task uses up more time and energy than doing the task itself."
> 3. Avoiding something painful seems sensible. But sadly, the long-term effects of habitual avoidance can be nasty.
> 4. Procrastination is a single, monumentally important "key-stone" bad habit.
> 5. It's easy to feel distaste for something you're not good at. But the better you get at something, the more you'll find you enjoy it.

1. 我们通常拖延的是会引起我们不舒适的事，其实这种痛苦是来自我们自己的预期，当我们真正做起来的时候，痛苦会消失。
2. 拖延是我们学习中一个很重要的坏习惯。
3. 短期拖延避免痛苦看起来是明智的，但是长期来看是很糟糕的。

## How the Brain Procrastinates
> 1. You think about something you don't particularly like, and the pain centers of your brain light up. So you shift and narrow your focus of attention to something more enjoyable. This causes you to feel better, at least temporarily.
> 2. Procrastination is like addiction. It offers temporary excitement and relief from boring reality.
> 3. Researchers have found that procrastination can even become a source of pride as well as an excuse for doing poorly.
> 4. Like any habit, procrastination is something you can simply fall into. You get your procrastination cue and unthingkingly relax into your comfortable procrastination response. Over time, your habitual, zombielike response in obtaining those temporary dollops of pleasure can gradually lower your self-confidence, leaving you with even less of a desire to learn how to work effectively. 
> 5. Procrastination can be like taking tiny amounts of poison. It may not seem harmful at the time. But the long-term effects can be very damaging.

1. 拖延的发生：不喜欢的事情，导致大脑感知痛苦，然后把注意力转移到更愉快的事情上。
2. 拖延其实是一种习惯，长期拖延最终会降低我们的自信，导致我们不能有效工作生活，就像毒药一样有害。
