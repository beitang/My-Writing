# 4 chunking and avoiding illusions of competence: The Keys to Becoming an "Equation Whisperer"
> In this chapter, we'll be talking about precisely what that problem is - involving how focus links to both understanding and memory.

1. 还没弄懂"Equation Whisperer"是什么意思？
2. 集中注意力是如何连接理解和记忆的呢？

## What Happens When You Focus Your Attention?
> 1. Focusing your attention to connect parts of the brain is an important part of the focused mode of learning. Interestingly, when you are stressed, your attentional octopus begins to lose the ability to make some of those connections. This is why your brain doesn't seem to work right when you're angry, stressed, or afraid.
> 2. Focused practice and repetition - the creation of memory traces - are also at the heart of an impeccably played golf stroke, a master chef's parcticed flip of an omelet, or a backetball free throw. In dance, it's a long way from a toddler's clumsy pirouette to the choreographed grace of a professional dancer. But that path to expertise is built bit by bit. Small memorized free spins, heel turns, and kicks become incorporated into larger, more creative interpretations.

1. Focused mode下学习会把我们的注意里连接到大脑的不同部分。当我们处于压力之下，我们会失去这种连接能力。
2. 集中注意力的练习和重复才能创造出记忆痕迹。
3. 从简单的练习到熟练时一点一点建立的。
4. 小块的记忆会慢慢合成为更大的更有创造力的大块理解。

## What Is a Chunk? Solomon's Chunking Problem
> 1. Chunks are pieces of information that are bound together through meaning.
> 2. The complex neural activity that ties together our simplying, abstract chunks of thought - whether those thoughts pertain to acronyms, ideas, or concepts - are the basic of much of science, literature, and art.
> 3. As it turns out, one of the first steps toward gaining expertise in math and science is to create conceptual chunks - mental leaps that unites separate bits of information through meaning. Chunking the information you deal with helps your brain run more effiecntly. Once you chunk an idea or concept, you don't need to remember all the little underlying details; you've got the main idea - the chunk - and that's enough.

1. Chunk是通过意义绑定到一起的信息片段。比如一个个字母组成的单词。
2. 掌握技能的其中第一步就是创造概念性的chunk，通过把单独的信息片段根据其意义组合到一起。
3. 组块信息能帮助大脑运行得更有效。形成组块信息后，不需要记住具体细节，只需要知道组块的主要含义就可以了。

## Basic Steps to Forming a Chunk
> 1. Chunks related to different concepts and procedures can be molded in many different ways.
> 2. Most of the details in the worked-out solution are right there, and your task is simply to figure out why the steps are taken the way they are. That can help you see the key features and underlying principles of a problem.
> 3. The one concern about using worked-out examples to form chunks is that it can be all too easy to focus too much on why an individual step works and not on the connection between steps - that is, on why this particular step is the next thing you should do.
> 4. The first step in chunking, then, is to simply focus your attention on the information you want to chunk.
> 5. The second step in chunking is to understand the basic idea you are trying to chunk.
> 6. Or at least, they can grasp those ideas if they allow the focused and diffuse modes of thinking to take turns in helping them figure out what's going on.
> 7. Understanding is like a superglue that helps hold the underlying memory traces together. It creates broad, encompassing traces that link to many memory traces. Can you create a chunk if you don't understand? Yes, but it's a useless chunk that won't fit in with other material you are learning.
> 8. That said, it's important to realize that just understanding how a problem was solved does not necessarily create a chunk that you can easily call to mind later.
> 9. The third step to chunking is gaining context so you see not just how, but also when to use this chunk. Context means going beyond the initial problem and seeing more broadly, repeating and practicing with both related and unrelated problems so you see not only when to use the chunk, but when not to use it. This helps you see how your newly formed chunk fits into the bigger picture.
> 10. Ultimately, practice helps you broaden the networks of neurons connected to your chunk, ensuring that it is not only firm, but also accessible from many different paths.
> 11. There is a bottom-up chunking process where practice and repetition can help you both build and strengthen each chunk, so you can easily gain access to it when needed. And there is a top-down "big picture" process that allows you to see where what you are learning fits in. Both processes are vital in gaining mastery over the material. Context is where bottom-up and top-down learning meet. To clarify here - chunking may involve your learning how to use a certain problem-solving technique. Context means learning when to use that technique instead of some other technique.
> 12. Skimming through a chapter or listening to a very well-organized lecture can allow you to gain a sense of the big picture. This can help you know where to put the chunks you are constructing. Learn the major concepts or points first - there are often the key parts of a good instructor or book chapter's outline, flow charts, tables, or concept maps. Once you have this done, fill in the details. Even if a few of the puzzle pieces are missing at the end of your studies, you can still see the big picture.

1. 我们常常是通过已知例子的解决方法来学习数学的，具体的解决细节都存在，我们需要理解为什么是这样的一步一步解决的，这样才能帮助我们看到解决的例子中隐藏的原则和主要特性。
2. 注意，学习有解决方法的例子的时候，不能只关注具体的每一步，还要关注步骤之间的联系。
3. 形成组块的三个步骤（但其实还有更多），集中注意力学习具体信息，理解学习的具体信息，理解上下文，什么时候可以用这个信息。
4. 从下到上建立组块和从上到下看到组块具体可以使用在哪里，两者相互作用，帮助学习。
