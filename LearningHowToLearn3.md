# easy does it: Why Trying Too Hard Can Sometimes Be Part of the Problem

这章内容摘抄好多呀，暂时没办法，一方面这些知识对自己比较新，另一方面自己的理解总结能力还不够。除了中文部分，最后一张对比的表格也是自己总结的。

> 1.  Before we go into how Carlsen psyched out Kasparov, we need to cover a couple of important ideas about **how people think**.
> 2.  We're going to be touching on some of the main themes of the book in this chapter, so don't be surprised if you have to toggle around a bit in your thinking. Being able to toggle your thinking - getting a glimpse of what you are learning before returning later to more fully understand what's going on, is itself one of the main ideas in the book!
> 3.  As you first begin looking at a chapter or section of a book that teaches concepts of math or science, it helps to take a "picture walk" through the chapter, glancing not only at the graphics, diagrams, and photos, but also at the section headings, summary, and even questions at the end of the chapter, if the book has them. This seems counterintuitive - you haven't actually read the chapter yet, but it helps prime your mental pump.
> 4.  You'll be surprised at how spending a minute or two glancing ahead before you read in depth will help you organize your thoughts. You're creating little neural hooks to hang your thinking on, making it easier to grasp the concepts.

这里提到一个学习技巧，先简略总体了解一下学习内容，然后再深入学习。比如看书的时候可以先过一下书中的图片，表格，章节的标题，总结，练习题等相对精炼的重要信息，这样可以形成一些基本印象，帮助组织你的想法。

## Focused versus Diffuse Thinking

> 1.  It seems you frequently switch back and forth between these two modes in your day-to-day activities. You're in either one mode or the other - not consciously in both at the same time. The diffuse mode does seem to be able to work quietly in the background on something you are not actively focusing on.
> 2.  Focused-mode thinking is essential for studying math and science. It involves a direct approach to solving problems using rational, sequential, analytical approaches. The focused mode is associated with the concentrating abilities of the brain's prefrontal cortex, located right behind your forehead. Turn your attention to something and bam - the focused mode is on, like the tight, penetrating beam of a flashlight.
> 3.  Diffuse-mode thinking is also essential for learning math and science. It allows us to suddenly gain a new insight on a problem we've been struggling with and is associated with "big-picture" perspectives. Diffuse-mode thinking is what happens when you relax your attention and just let your mind wander. This relaxation can allow different areas of the brain to hook up and return valuable insights. Unlike the focused mode, the diffuse mode seems less affiliated with any one area of the brain - you can think of it as being "diffused" throughout the brain. Diffuse-mode insights often flow from preliminary thinking that's been done in the focused mode.
> 4.  Learning involves a complex flickering of neural processing among different areas of the brain, as well as back and forth between hemispheres. So this means that thinking and learning is more complicated than simply switching between the focused and diffuse modes.

## The Focused Mode - A Tight Pinball Machine

> 1.  Metaphors are powerful tools for learning in math and science.
> 2.  Notice how the round bumpers are very close together in the focused mode. In contrast, the diffuse mode on the right has its circular rubber bumpers farther apart.
The close bumpers of the focused mode mean that you can more easily think a precise thought. Basically, the focused mode is used to concentrate on something that's already tightly connected in your mind, often because you are familiar and comfortable with the underlying concepts.
> 3.  That broader path shows how the focused-mode thought is following along a route you've already practiced or experienced.
> 4.  When you focus on something, the consciously attentive prefrontal cortex automatically sends out signals along neural pathways. These signals link different areas of your brain related to what you're thinking about.
> 5.  The octopus has only so many tentacles to make connections, just as your working memory has only so many things it can hold at once.
> 6.  The focused approach relates to intense concentrate on a specific problem or concept. But while in focused mode, sometimes you inadvertently find yourself focusing intently and trying to solve a problem using erroneous thoughts that are in a different place in the brain from the "solution"thoughts you need to actually need to solve the problem.
The diffuse approach on the right often involves a big-picture perspective. This thinking mode is useful when you are learning something new. As you can see, the diffuse mode doesn't allow you to focus tightly and intently to solve a specific problem - but it can allow you to get closer to where that solution lies because you're able to travel much farther before running into another bumper.

1. 一个强大的学习技巧（工具）－类比。
2. 提出有限工作记忆区的概念，以后还会详细解说。

## Why Math and Science Can Be More Challenging
> 1. This may be because humans haven't evolved over the millennia to manipulate mathematical ideas, which are frequently more abstractly encrypted than those of conventional language. Obviously, we can still think about math and science - it's just that the abstractness and encryptedness adds a level - sometimes a number of levels - of complexity.
> 2. This is why dealing with procrastination, while important in studying any discipline, is particularly important in math and science.
> 3. Related to these difficulties in math and science is anther challenge. It's called the Einstellung effect. In this phenomenon, an idea you already have in mind, or your simple initial thought, prevents a better idea or solution from being found.
> 4. The German word Einstellung means "installation" - basically you can remember Einstellung as installing a roadblock because of the way you are initially looking at something.
> 5. This kind of wrong approach is especially easy to do in science because sometimes your initial intuition about what's happening is misleading. You have to unlearn your erroneous older ideas even while you're learning new ones.
> 6. The Einstellung effect is a frequent stumbling block for students. It's not just that sometimes your natural intuitions need to be retrained - it's that sometimes it is tough even figuring out where to begin, as when tackling a homework problem.
> 7. This is precisely why one significant mistake students sometimes make in learning math and science is jumping into the water before they learn to swim. In other words, they blindly start working on homework without reading the textbook, attending lectures, viewing online lessons, or speaking with someone knowledgable.

1. 不同的学科在抽象性和编码复杂性（?encryptedness）上的不同，会导致学习难度和方法的不同。
2. 拖延对学习有很大影响，以后还会详细解说。
3. 按我的理解，简单的讲Einstellung效应是指我们一开始的想法会限制我们的思路，让我们反而找不到正确的思路。它是我们学习中需要克服的一大挑战。在两个模式间切换可以帮助解决这个问题。

## The Diffuse Mode - A Spread-Out Pinball Machine
> 1. If you are grappling with a new concept or trying to solve a new problem, you don't have preexisting neural patterns to help guide your thoughts - there's no fuzzy underlying pathway to help guide you. You may need to range widely to encounter a potential solution. For this, diffuse mode is just the ticket!
> 2. If you are trying to understand or figure out something new, your best bet is to turn off your precision-focused thinking and turn on your "big picture" diffuse mode, long enough to be able to latch on to a new, more fruitful approach.
> 3. The harder you push your brain to come up with something creative, the less creative your ideas will be.

两种模式都很重要，以后还会学习一些如何在两个模式间切换的技巧。

## Why Are There Two Modes of Thinking?
> 1. Why do we have these two different thinking modes? The answer may be related to two major problems that vertebrates have had in staying alive and passing their genes on to their offspring.
> 2. In humans, we see a similar splitting of brain functions. The left side of the brains is somewhat more associated with careful, focused attention. It also seems more specialized for handling sequential information and logical thinking - the first step leaders to the second step, and so on. The right seems more tied to diffuse scanning of the environment and interacting with other people, and seems more associated with processing emotions. It also is linked with handling simultaneous, big-picture processing.
> 3. To learn about and be creative in math and science, we need to strengthen and use both the focused and diffuse modes.
> 4. Evidence suggests that to grapple with a difficult problem, we must first put hard, focused-mode effort into it. Here's the interesting part: The diffuse mode is also often an important part of problem solving, especially when the problem is difficult. But as long as we are consciously focusing on a problem, we are blocking the diffuse mode.
> 5. Embrace befuddlement: Befuddlement is a healthy part of the learning process.
> 6. The bottom line is that problem solving in any discipline often involves an exchange between the two fundamentally different modes. One mode will process the information it receives and then send the result back to the other mode. This volleying of information back and forth as the brain works its way toward a conscious solution appears essential for understanding and solving all but trivial problems and concepts.

1. 为什么有这两种思考方式，又得从人类繁衍进化发展的角度来看了，似乎很多问题的答案都需要从这个角度来看。
2. 一个心理理念的转变：学习过程中的迷惑是完全正常的，不要觉得是自己不擅长。
3. 解决问题需要在两种模式之间不断切换，传递信息。

## Procrastination Preclude
> 1. For now, keep in mind that when you procrastinate, you are leaving yourself only enough time to do superficial focused-mode learning. You are also increasing your stress level because you know you have to complete what feels like an unpleasant task. The resulting neural patterns will be faint and fragmented and will quickly disappear - you'll be left with a shaky foundation.
> 2. If you often find yourself procrastinating, as many of us do, here's a tip. Turn off your phone and any sounds or sights (or websites) that might signal an interruption. Then set a timer for twenty-five minutes and put yourself toward doing a twenty-five-minute interlude of work focused on a task - any task. Don't worry about finishing the task - just worry about working on it. Once the twenty-five minutes is up, reward yourself with web surfing, checking your phone, or whatever you like to do. This reward is as important as the work itself.

1. 拖延又出现了，先记住一点，拖延会导致你只能进行肤浅的focused-mode的学习，并且增加紧张感，所以学到的东西都是不扎实的。
2. 克服拖延的一个方法，不被打扰的25分钟，专注在做事而不是结果上。
3. 奖励自己也很重要。

## Pause and Recall
> Close the book and look away. What were the main ideas of this chapter? Don't worry if you can't recall very much when you first begin trying this. As you continue practicing this technique, you'll begin noticing changes in how you read and how much you recall.

复述应该能够帮助自己解决书看了就忘的问题，复述能力本身也需要不断锻炼。能复述，能交给其他人才是真正学会的表现。

## 两种模式对比
| Comparison | Focused Mode | Diffuse Mode |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Mind state | highly attentive states | more relaxed resting states |
| Solve problem | a direct approach to solving problems using rational, sequential, analytical approaches | suddenly gain a new insight on a problem |
| Thinking perspective | concentrating | broader, big-picture |
| Brain area involved | associated with the concentrating abilities of the brain's prefrontal cortex | less affiliated with any one area of the brain, as being "diffused" throughout the brain |
| When better to use | something already tightly connected in your mind, you are familar and comfortable with the underlying concept | when you are learning something new, you don't have preexisting neural patterns to help guide your thoughts |
