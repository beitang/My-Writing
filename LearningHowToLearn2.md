探索如何学习系列2 － 《A Mind for Numbers》之《1. Open the Door》
《A Mind for Numbers》是Coursera课程《Learning How to Learn》讲师Barbara写的如何学习的书，课程介绍里提到了这本书。这个课程其实我在去年就完成了，但是却没对自己的学习产生什么实际效果。这次因为新生大学元学习课Xdite老师的推荐，我想重新开始学习，为了不因为学过产生厌倦，就从这本书重新开始吧！担心自己不能坚持看完，担心自己看了就忘，所以要求自己读完每一章，即使只有很少的几页，也写一点读书笔记和自己的心得。

foreword

Surprisingly, your brain can also work on a problem even while you are sleeping and are not aware of anything. But it does this only if you concentrate on trying to solve the problem before falling asleep.
我也体验过这种事情，一整天都在思考一个问题的解决方案，睡觉的时候感觉也在思考，有时早上醒来的时候就有了一个可行的方案。

preface

When we read material over and over, the material becomes familiar and fluent, meaning it is easy for our minds to process. We then think that this easy processing is a sign that we have learned something well, even though we have not.
这种被动重复阅读让我们陷入一种认知幻觉。想想自己读书，读了两三遍，内容直接抄写，但发现还是过段时间就忘，没办法运用起来。

作者在这一章简要讲述了自己的学习经历，从擅长语言类的学习，讨厌理工科学习，到高中后机缘巧合不得不进行理工科学习，最后成为工程学科的教授的经历。以此证明科学的学习方法是可以有效提升学习效果的。我的疑问是作者毕竟是擅长某类学科的学习的，智商之类想来还是不错的，那书里的方法对于所有学科都很差的人，是否有用呢？

Now, I realize that my problem was rooted in two distinctly different modes for viewing the world.
这两种模式分别是什么呢？为什么会有这么大的差别？带着这个问题接着看书。

I spent lots of time gaining this expertise - the better I got, the more I enjoyed what I was doing. And the more I enjoyed what I was doing, the more time I spent on it. My success reinforced my desire to practice, and that built more success.
我们往往对于自己擅长的技能投入更多时间学习，形成正循环不断提升，这很好。但同时我们如何坚持投入时间到自己不擅长的技能呢？现代社会的发展需要我们不断学习新技能，很可能都是我们不擅长的。

I began to pick up little tricks about not only how to study but when to quit. I learned that internalizing certain concepts and techniques could be a powerful tool. I also learned not to take on too much at once, allowing myself plenty of time to practice even if it meant my classmates would sometimes graduate ahead of me because I wasn't taking as many courses each semester as they were.
这里讲到了一些学习技巧，后面应该会有更详细的叙述。

If you don't consider yourself naturally good at math and science, you may be surprised to learn that the brain is designed to do extraordinary mental calculations. We do them every time we catch a ball, or rock our body to the beat of a song, or maneuver our car around a pothole in the road. We often do complex calculations, solving complex equations unconsciously, unaware that we sometimes already know the solution as we slowly work toward it. In fact, we all have a natural feel and flair for math and science. Basically, we just need to master the lingo and culture.
我们的很多行为其实都涉及到很多潜意识的复杂计算，所以从这个角度来看我们天生也许都是善于计算的。我们改进的第一步，也许应该从改变自己认定自己天生就不擅长数学开始。

It is designed to expose your thought processes so you can understand how your mind learns - and also how your mind sometimes fools you into believing you're learning, when you're actually not.
把学习过程中的思考过程展现出来，看看我们的大脑到底是如何学习的，应该能发现很多有用的学习技巧。

What you discover will help you be more effective and creative, not only in math and science, but in almost everything you do.
相信这本书不止能帮助我们学习数学，也可以帮助更有效地学习所有技能。
