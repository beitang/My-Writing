# 3 learning is creating: Lessons from Thomas Edison's Frying Pan

## Shifting between the Focused and Diffuse Modes

> 1.  For most people, shifting from focused to diffuse mode happens naturally if you distract yourself and then allow a little time to pass.
> 2.  The key is to do something else until your brain is consciously free of any thought of the problem. Unless other tricks are brought into play, this generally takes several hours.
> 3.  Once you are distracted from the problem at hand, the diffuse mode has access and can begin pinging about in its big-picture way to settle on a solution.
> 4.  It can take a lot of hard focused-mode work beforehand, but the sudden, unexpected solution that emerges from the diffuse mode can make it feel almost like the "aha!" mode.

从focused mode切换到diffuse mode，需要做一些其他事情来转移之前的思考，而且这需要一些时间，一般是几个小时。

## Creativity Is about Harnessing and Extending Your Abilities

> 1.  Wild surrealist painter Salvador Dali, like Thomas Edison, also used a nap and the clatter of an object falling from his hand to tap into his diffuse-mode creative perspectives.
> 2.  Enlisting the diffuse mode helps you learn at a deep and creative level. There is much creativity underlying math and science problem solving. Many people think that there's only one way to do a problem, but there are often a number of different solutions, if you have the creativity to see them.
> 3.  Many people think they are not creative, when that is simply untrue. We all have the ability to make new neural connections and pull from memory something that was never put there in the first place.

1.  爱迪生和达利都通过进入diffuse mode来帮助自己获得创造力。
2.  自己一直觉得只有艺术之类才算有创造力的活动，原来数学也需要创造力的，想来那些数学定理的证明确实需要创造力，看来是自己有想法偏见了。
3.  又得更新自己的一个观念，不能认为自己是没有创造力的，我们的大脑就是会在不同的记忆之间建立联系，这些联系就是创造的来源。

## Working Back and Forth between Modes to Master Material

> 1.  We learn a great deal from our failures in math and science. Know that you are making progress with each mistake you catch when trying to solve a problem - finding errors should give you a sense of satisfaction.
> 2.  Mistakes are inevitable.
> 3.  Sleep is probably the most effective and important factor in allowing your diffuse mode to tackle a difficult problem.
> 4.  In other words, just using your diffuse mode doesn't mean you can lollygag around and expect to get anywhere. As the days and weeks pass, it's the distributed practice - the back and forth between focused-mode attention and diffuse-mode relaxation - that does the trick.
> 5.  Enlisting the focused mode, which is often what you need to do to first get a problem into your brain, requires your full attention. Studies have shown that we have only so much mental energy - willpower - for this type of thinking. When your energy flags, sometimes you can take a break by jumping to other focused-type tasks, such as switching from studying math to studying French vocabulary. But the longer you spend in focused mode, the more mental resources you use.
> 6.  Consistency over time is key!

1.  单单只有diffuse mode是没有用的，两种模式在学习过程中的切换才能有效。
2.  Focused mode的学习和思考需要消耗我们的意志力，而意志力是有限的，使用时间越长，消耗越多。所以我们需要休息，一方面恢复我们的意志力，另一方面也让diffuse mode的思考开始起作用。
3.  记住，最终的成功不是靠一时的努力，而是持续的努力。

## Use these diffuse-mode tools as rewards after firm focused-mode work

### General Diffuse-Mode Activators

> 1.  Go to the gym
> 2.  Play a sport like soccer or basketball
> 3.  Jog, walk, or swim
> 4.  Dance
> 5.  Go for a drive (or tag along for the ride)
> 6.  Draw or paint
> 7.  Take a bath or shower
> 8.  Listen to music, especially without words
> 9.  Play songs you know well on a musical instrument
> 10.  Meditate or pray
> 11.  Sleep (the ultimate diffuse mode!)

这些是常用的让思考进入diffuse mode的活动。

### Other Diffuse-Mode Activators: are best used briefly, as rewards. (These activities may pull you into a more focused mode than the above activities.)

> 1.  Play video games
> 2.  Surf the web
> 3.  Talk to friends
> 4.  Volunteer to help someone with a simple task
> 5.  Read a relaxing book
> 6.  Text friends
> 7.  Go to a movie or play
> 8.  Television (dropping a remote if you fall asleep doesn't count)

这类活动还是要消耗意志力的，所以不能使用太长时间。

## Don't Worry about Keeping Up with the Intellectual Joneses

> 1.  If you need more time to learn math and science, that's simply the reality.
> 2.  You may be surprised to discover that learning slowly can mean you learn more deeply than your fast-thinking classmates. One of the most important tricks that helped me retool my brain was learning to avoid the temptation to take too many math and science classes at once.

1.  不要试图赶上学习特别快的人，接受自己需要更多的时间来学习，找到自己的节奏，学得慢一点学得深入一点。
2.  我在想，自己学东西算比较快，是不是反过来也有不利的一面，容易浅尝辄止，觉得可以解决大部分问题了，就不想继续深入了。

## Avoid Einstellung (Getting Stuck)

> 1.  Remember, accepting the first idea that comes to mind when you are working on an assignment or test problem can prevent you from finding a better solution.
> 2.  According to recent research, blinking is a vital activity that provides another means of reevaluating a situation.
> 3.  This is a hint that you, too, may be able to develop ways to quickly toggle between the focused and diffuse modes as you develop your expertise in a subject.
> 4.  Figuring out a difficult problem or learning a new concept almost always requires one or more periods when you aren't consciously working on the problem. Each interlude in which you are not directly focused on the problem allows your diffuse mode to look at it in a fresh way. When you turn your focused attention back to the problem, you consolidate new ideas and patterns that the diffuse mode has delivered.
> 5.  The resting times between your focused-mode efforts should be long enough to get your conscious mind completely off the problem you're working on. Usually a few hours is long enough for the diffuse mode to make significant progress but not so long that its insights fade away before being passed on to the focused mode. A good rule of thumb, when you are first learning new concepts, is not to let things go untouched for longer than a day.
> 6.  The diffuse mode not only allows you to look at the material in new ways but also appears to allow you to synthesize and incorporate the new ideas in relation to what you already know. This idea of looking from fresh perspective also gives us insight on why "sleeping on it" before making major decisions is generally a good idea, and why taking vacations is important.
> 7.  Working in the focused mode is like providing the bricks, while working in the diffuse mode is like gradually joining the bricks together with mortar.
> 8.  Observe Yourself: Next time you find yourself becoming frustrated at something or someone, try taking a mental step back and observing your reaction. Anger and frustration can occasionally have their place in motivating us to succeed, but they can also shut down key areas of the brain that we need in order to learn. Rising frustration is usually a good timeout signal for you, signaling that you need to shift to diffuse mode.

1.  两种模式之间的切换的速度也是可以通过练习提升的，具体该如何提升呢？
2.  两种模式切换一次或多次才能解决一个难题或学习一个新概念，两者相互作用才能巩固学到的新知识。
3.  两次focused mode的努力之间一般需要几个小时来让diffuse mode起效，但是间隔时间也不能太长，以致完全遗忘。一个简单的原则是，当你学习新概念的时候，不碰这些概念的间隔不应超过一天。
4.  Diffuse mode不但可以让我们从新的视角来学习，还可以把新的知识整合或者联系到已知的知识中。从这个角度来看，我们在做重要决定的时候，应该带着这个决定睡一觉，第二天起床的时候看看有没有需要修订的。
5.  要学会观察自己，当发现自己有失落的情绪的时候，也许就是我们该切换到diffuse mode的时候啦。

## What to Do When You're Really Stumped
> 1. People with strong self-control can have the most difficulty in getting themselves to turn off their focused mode so that the diffuse mode can begin its work.
> 2. Make it a rule to listen to study partners, friends, or loved ones who can sense when you are becoming dangerously frustrated.
> 3. Ask someone else for a different perspective on how to solve the problem or a different analogy to understand the concept; however, it's best that you first wrestle with the problem yourself before you talk to anyone else, because it can embed the basic concepts deeply enough that you become receptive to the explanation.

1. 当身边的人发现我们陷入问题开始沮丧的时候，我们应该听他们的建议转移一下注意力，进入diffuse mode。
2. 当我们确实被问题困住时，我们可以寻求别人的不同角度的意见。但是如果自己是一个人自学，找不到可以直接询问的人，怎么办？网上发帖询问？

## Understanding the Paradoxes of Learning
> Learning is often paradoxical. The very thing we need in order to learn impedes our ability to learn. We need to focus intently to be able to solve problems - yet that focus can also block us from accessing the fresh approach we may need. Success is important, but critically, so is failure. Persistence is key - but misplaced persistence causes needless frustration.

后续要总结一下有关学习的悖论，感觉一个特性总有正反两面。

## Introduction to Working and Long-Term Memory
> 1. Working memory is the part of memory that has to do with what you are immediately and consciously processing in your mind. It used to be thought that our working memory could hold around seven items, or "chunks," but it's now widely believed that the working memory holds only about four chunks of information.
> 2. The four items only stay in the air - or in working memory - because you keep adding a little energy. This energy is needed so your metabolic vampires - natural dissipating processes - don't such the memories aways. In other words, you need to maintain these memories actively; otherwise, your body will divert your energy elsewhere, and you'll forget the information you've taken in.
> 3. Your working memory is important in learning math and science because it's like your own private mental blackboard where you can jot down a few ideas that you are considering or trying to understand.
> 4. How do you keep things in working memory? Often it's through rehearsal.
> 5. In contrast, long-term memory might be thought of as a storage warehouse. Once items are in there, they generally stay put. The warehouse is large, with room for billions of items, and it can be easy for stored parcels to get buried so deeply that it's difficult to retrieve them. Research has shown that when your brain first puts an item of information in long-term memory, you need to revisit it a few times to increase the chances you'll later be able to find it when you need it.
> 6. Long-term memory is important for learning math and science because it is where you store the fundamental concepts and techniques that you need to use in problem solving. It takes time to move information from working memory to long-term memory. To help with this process, use a technique called spaced repetition.

1. 以前认为working memory可以同时处理7个chunk，现在普遍认为只能处理4个，看来认知领域的一些研究结论也是不断在变化的。
2. 这里引入了chunk这个概念，后续有专门章节的讲述。
3. 保持chunk在working memory需要消耗能量，不断复述，否则很容易就忘记了。
4. Long-term memory存储空间大，不易遗忘，但是有时提取这部分记忆比较困难，也需要一些重复提取来增加被提取的几率。
5. 把信息从working memory记录到long-term memory的技巧是间歇性重复，但是具体该如何操作呢？

## Let Your Mind Work in the Background
> The next time you are tackling a touch problem, work on it for a few minutes. When you get stuck, move on to another problem. Your diffuse mode can continue working on the tougher problem in the background. When you later return to the tougher problem, you will often be pleasantly surprised by the progress you've made.

这一招感觉在考试的时候会挺有用的，一道题卡住了先做下一题，其实大脑在背后也还是在思考前一道题的。

## The Importance of Sleep in Learning
> 1. You may be surprised to learn that simply being awake creates toxic products in your brain. During sleep, your cells shrink, causing a striking increase in the space between your cells. This is equivalent to turning on a faucet - it allows fluid to wash past and push the toxins out. This nightly housecleaning is part of what keeps your brain healthy.
> 2. Studies have shown that sleep is a vital part of memory and learning. Part of what this special sleep-time tidying does is erase trivial aspects of memories and simultaneously strengthen areas of importance. During sleep, your brain also rehearses some of the tougher parts of whatever you are trying to learn - going over and over neural patterns to deepen and strengthen them.
> 3. Finally, sleep has been shown to make a remarkable difference in people's ability to figure out difficult problems and to find meaning and understanding in what they are learning.
> 4. If you're tired, it's often best to just go to sleep and get up a little earlier the next day, so your reading is done with a better-rested brain.

1. 睡眠能排除毒素，保持大脑健康，非常重要，看来得想想如何提高睡眠质量了。
2. 睡眠还能加强重要的记忆，进入diffuse mode来思考问题。
3. 累了就早点睡吧，第二天早点起就是了，休息不好时，大脑状态不好，做事效率也不高。

## Ingredients for Creativity
> 1. Research on the biology of creativity suggests several ingredients that we all can bake into our personal recipes for success. Number one is the Nike factor: Just do it!
> 2. Creativity is a numbers game.
> 3. Dealing with fear.
> 4. Redos come with the territory.
> 5. Criticism makes us better.
> 6. Be willing to be disagreeable.

拥有创造力的要素，第一就是做起来，做得越多越好，不要害怕，重做是难免的，批评有利于提高，不被接受的往往意味着更大的创新。
